## Vision


The **EdTech Supply Chain** smart contract is designed to streamline and secure the tracking and verification of educational products. By leveraging blockchain technology, this contract ensures that each product's authenticity and ownership can be transparently verified, reducing the risk of counterfeit products and fraudulent claims.

## Features

- **Register Products**: Allows users to register new educational products, assigning them a unique ID and marking them as authentic by default.
- **Transfer Ownership**: Enables the transfer of product ownership from one user to another, maintaining an accurate record of ownership.
- **Verify Authenticity**: Provides a mechanism to check if a product is authenticated or not.
- **Track Ownership**: Allows anyone to view the current owner of a product.
